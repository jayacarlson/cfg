See cfg.go for specific information on the different Config types and
their specific syntax.  But in general, all labels must start the line
(no leading whitespace) along with the type specific identifier, and
must be the only thing on that line.

Generally anything outside a config block is ignored.  The exception
is the ConfigValue that matches with 'label := value' on any line.

For the Config Block, all text is included; extra whitespace and the
comment lines (lines starting with '#') which are normally ignored by
the other Config types.

For Config Data (a scoped grouping of the other Config types) all
contained lines must have a leading TAB character, which is removed
before the data is recursed into for the sub data types.
